# ATM Web App (React + TypeScript)

A small ATM simulator built with React + TypeScript. It matches the provided mocks, uses reducer-based state, and supports PIN entry, balance check, deposits, and withdrawals. The side pads act as the menu buttons, and the card sprite shows a transparent row first, then overlays the active opaque card after login.

## Available Scripts

Go to frontend path and:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

got to http://localhost:3000/ and use the mock user's pin: 1234
