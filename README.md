# ATM Web App (React + TypeScript)

A small ATM simulator built with React + TypeScript. It matches the provided mocks, uses reducer-based state, and supports PIN entry, balance check, deposits, and withdrawals. The side pads act as the menu buttons, and the card sprite shows a transparent row first, then overlays the active opaque card after login.

## Guidelines:

- Please work in React, using Javascript or Typescript, and utilize any additional frameworks or libraries as needed.
- Incorporate state management effectively in your application.
- Utilize React hooks for managing state and side effects.
- Match the provided mocks as closely as possible.
- Please use provided assets.
- A user should be able to check their balance, withdraw funds, and deposit funds after entering their PIN at a minimum.
- Funds should be correctly reflected after a deposit or withdrawal.
- A user's card type should be highlighted once they have entered their correct PIN.
- Please put your code up on your GitHub account.
- Please include instructions about how we can run your app. (If your solution works better in one browser over the others, let us know which one.)

## Available Scripts
